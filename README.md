# Product Quantities Analysis and Forecasting Using Linear Regression
To analyze and predict the quantities of the sold products for the next period.

This is the notebook written in python programming language to analyze the quantities of sold product from XX company.
I was asked to predict the quantities sold for the next period and I decided to use Linear Regression with window size of 2.
I also tried to use ARIMA and SARIMA but the model can't predict better than Linear Regression so I dropped it from main notebook in the middle of work.
